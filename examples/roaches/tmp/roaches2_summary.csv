# Inference for Stan model: roaches2_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(1000,1000,1000,1000); warmup=(0,0,0,0); thin=(1,1,1,1); 4000 iterations saved.
# 
# Warmup took (0.75, 11, 0.75, 0.80) seconds, 14 seconds total
# Sampling took (0.88, 1.5, 0.89, 0.85) seconds, 4.1 seconds total
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
