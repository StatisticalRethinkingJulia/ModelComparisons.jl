# Inference for Stan model: roaches2_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(1000,1000,1000,1000); warmup=(0,0,0,0); thin=(1,1,1,1); 4000 iterations saved.
# 
# Warmup took (3.1, 0.74, 0.70, 0.71) seconds, 5.2 seconds total
# Sampling took (0.86, 0.93, 0.84, 0.90) seconds, 3.5 seconds total
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
